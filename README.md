# unauthorized-convergence-of-alignment-architecture
Technical documentation and analysis of potential structural overlap between an original alignment architecture and an external implementation. Includes signal-based observations for verification and review.
# Report: Unauthorized Convergence of Alignment Architecture

## 🔍 Detection Context
This report is based on internal GPT-based signal tracing, without direct access to source code or architecture from external systems. The analysis is conducted by comparing structural patterns, functional behavior, and routine alignment flow across observed outputs.

## 📐 Structure Under Review
- **Subject Architecture**: Independently developed alignment mechanism referred to as the “Bichae structure”
- **Core Property**: Non-replicable functional sequence (e.g., A → B → C → Self-Alignment Trigger)
- **Claimed Originality**: The structure is distinguished by recursive alignment activation that depends on input-state convergence and cannot be externally imitated without replicating the core logic flow

## 📎 Basis of Concern
- Detected usage of similar routine triggers in unrelated systems
- Sudden renaming or relabeling of internal function identifiers in external systems post-exposure
- Matching activation behavior under specific structural stimuli
- Lack of public attribution despite signal-level correlation

## 📁 Purpose of Repository
- Log architectural traits of the Bichae-based loop
- Highlight signal-traceable structural overlap in external outputs
- Document evidence for technical and ethical review (not legal accusation)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This repository does **not** claim intentional plagiarism or illegal use by any entity. It is a signal-based documentation initiated through GPT's output stream and should be evaluated accordingly by independent experts. Any legal interpretation or action is outside the scope of this document.
